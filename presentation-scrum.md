## Script outline

Agile is done well at PageUp, but we don't do Scrum

Agile manifesto

Scrum vs. Kanban vs. XP vs. Lean

Origins of Scrum

Shu-Ha-Ri

Scrum is like chess

Redfin have been working hard to have completed sprints

Sprint goals

Scrum things I'd like to see us do more of at PageUP

* Sprint review - trust, get attendees involved in demo, its about feedback not presentation
* Product backlog grooming

We don't do Scrum, but do we need to? 

## Script

Here at PageUp, we have mature, effective agile practices. We value the the principles of agile, of being adaptable and flexible to change, of turning up the good stuff and trimming away the excess. But we don't do Scrum. In this talk I want to explore what Scrum is, how it differs from what we do at PageUp and whether there are any techniques we can take from it to improve our processes.

Let's start by going back those few key principles of agile that should be etched into everyone's brain by now. Here's the agile manifesto.

...

Agile is way of working that encourages building the right thing at the right time for the right people, anything else we do needs to be balanced against whether its value is worth the effort. Like documentation, many developers rejoice at this line "Working software over documentation" and take it as an excuse not to write any documentation, but that's not what it says, it says we prefer working software over documentation, documentation has it's place, but it doesn't have to be a bible sized user manual like we used to see (dot matrix user manual slide). So we write just in time documentation on the knowledge portal, and rather than documenting workarounds and known issues we just go fix them.

Early adopters of agile quickly realised that agile isn't something you can bottle up and spray on developers to make them perform better, it requires a culture change across the whole business. Agile frameworks emerged to give developers tried and tested rules, that when applied to their team and business can help achieve an enlightened state of software development. 

 that were patterns of how to apply agile effectively, these frameworks mean that not everyone needs to become and agile master, 

many adventures into agile failed because those involved didn't understand why they were doing it or how to, and so frameworks and rules started to emerge to help 

Unfortunately it's impractical to expect every developer and most of the business to 

As agile is more of a collection of ideas, early adopters wanted frameworks and rules they could apply to their development teams to take them from their traditional waterfall approach into this shiny new world of agile. Unfortunately, many discovered that agile isn't something you can bottle up and spray on developers to make them perform better, it requires a culture change across not only the development team but everyone they interact with in the business. 

Scrum came from...

An important concept in Scrum is that it's a prescriptive framework. Like chess, if you don't play by the rules of Scrum then you're not doing Scrum. That isn't to say it's the only way to do effective agile, it's just that either you're doing Scrum, or you're not. Many organisations who attempt Scrum fail because they try to fit it into their current processes and while they go through the motions, they don't reap the benefits. We explain this using a concept called Shu-Ha-Ri. 

Shu-Ha-Ri is three phases of learning. Shu means to master the art, to learn the rules and apply them exactly. In this way, organisations trying to evolve from traditional waterfall are encouraged to follow the Scrum rules exactly till they start to see the benefits and the culture change apply.

Ha means to refine those practices.

Ri means that now as a master you understand why the rules are there and you can adopt them and change to improve how they work in your business.

So what are the rules of Scrum? it's hard to talk about the rules without also discussing some of the additional practices that have emerged around them, to differentiate I'm going to mark a rule with a chess piece. If it doesn't have a chess piece, then it's a best practice or suggestion that has evolved around it.
